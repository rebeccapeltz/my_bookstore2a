# Tutorial on working with Ruby and Cloudinary

```
bundle install
```

## Correction
Becky Peltz (rebecca.peltz) 11:49 AM
need to add `gem "sqlite3", "~> 1.3.6"` to gemfile for video 1

```
rails generate model book title:string description:text image:string
```

```
rails s
```

## Homework
* Add another text_field in your form to get a remote URL of an image.
That should be for the :image attribute of ‘Book’.
* Include Cloudinary’s GEM (in the ‘Gemfile’ file).
* Shut down the server, and run bundle install in the terminal.
* Get your YML file (make sure you‘re logged in to your own account first!).
Store ‘cloudinary.yml’ in the /config/ folder, e.g., .../my_bookstore/config/cloudinary.yml.
* Only then start Rails server again (rails s).
* Use Cloudinary’s “fetch” for this image and show it in 3 different sizes:
* 50x50 on the ‘index’ page.
* 200x200 on the ‘show’ page.
* Optional - The latter should be a clickable link, which redirects to the full sized image. Any additional Cloudinary transformation of your choice is welcomed of course.

```
<%= cl_image_tag "sample"%>
```

```
rails c
a = Book.last
```

```
fetch_image_tag
type="fetch"
```

How to get around forking error on Mac
https://blog.phusion.nl/2017/10/13/why-ruby-app-servers-break-on-macos-high-sierra-and-what-can-be-done-about-it/

```
export OBJC_DISABLE_INITIALIZE_FORK_SAFETY=YES
```

replace
    <%= fetch_image_tag(@book.image, width:200, height:200, crop: "fill") if @book.image %>
with
    <%= fetch_image_tag(@book.image, width:200, height:200, crop: "fill") if @book.image %>

Cloudinary::Utils.signed_preloaded_image image
where image is json returned from uploading image

response is a string same as response from jquery uploads
resource type, type, version

identifier:
q=Cloudinary::PreloadedFile.new image  # use string returned above
q.public_id
q.version ...  

Destroy all books
```
Book.delete_all
```
To run mini-magick on Mac server install
```
brew update
brew install imagemagick
```

For upload with Cloudinary Carrierwave
`<%= f.file_field :image, html: {id: 'qwe'} %>`  


becomes
`<%= f.cl_image_upload :image, html: {id: 'qwe'} %>`
